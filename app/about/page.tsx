      <p className="mb-4">
        JetSet Direct was built on experience and opportunity. After more than
        15 years in the collision industry, I knew what it meant to take care of
        people during stressful times. Later, I drove for Uber and Lyft and saw
        both the demand and the limitations of rideshare. Passengers wanted more
        than just “point A to point B” — they wanted reliability,
        professionalism, and comfort.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        That’s when I realized there was room for something better: a premium
        ground service that sits a step above Uber and Lyft. JetSet Direct was
        created to deliver that experience — consistent, elevated service for
        airport transfers and beyond.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Outside of work, I race vintage race cars with my dad and have a
        lifelong love of aviation. I hold a private pilot’s license, and that
        passion for precision and professionalism carries over into the way I
        operate JetSet Direct.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        My goal is simple: provide excellent customer service, enjoy great
        conversations, and meet incredible people along the way.
      </p>

        We’re not just another ride. We’re your first-class option on the
        ground.
